üì∞ Fake News Classification using RNN & LSTM
This project tackles the challenge of detecting fake news using deep learning models, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. It forms part of an academic assignment (A3_48) and emphasizes the use of sequential models for natural language processing (NLP).

üìö Project Overview
Fake news detection is crucial in the digital age. This project focuses on building deep learning models that can understand and classify text sequences to determine whether a news article is fake or real.

Key steps include:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, padding, stopword removal)

Word embedding using Keras Tokenizer

Deep learning models:

Simple RNN

LSTM networks

Performance evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics

üìÅ File Structure
